# Ralph Gold Anchor

Task: 1 - Define the project structure and scaffolding

Repo reality:
- branch: main
- git status --porcelain:
```
<clean>
```
- git diff --stat:
```
<no diff>
```

Constraints:
- Work on exactly ONE task per iteration
- Do not claim completion without passing gates
- Prefer minimal diffs; keep repo clean
