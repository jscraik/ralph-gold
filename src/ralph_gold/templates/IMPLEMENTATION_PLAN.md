# IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

This file is the **persistent shared state** for the Ralph loop.

- Keep it short.
- Keep it prioritized (most important unfinished items first).
- One checkbox item should be implementable in **one iteration / one commit**.

If the plan becomes stale, it is cheap to regenerate: re-run planning mode and rewrite it.
