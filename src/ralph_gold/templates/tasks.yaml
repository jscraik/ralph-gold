version: 1

metadata:
  # Project metadata (optional)
  project: my-project

tasks:
  # Example task with all fields
  - id: 1
    title: Example task - implement feature X
    description: |
      Detailed description of what needs to be done.
      This field is optional but recommended for complex tasks.
    group: default # Parallel execution group (default: "default")
    priority: 1 # Task priority for sorting (optional)
    completed: false
    acceptance:
      - Acceptance criterion 1: feature works as expected
      - Acceptance criterion 2: tests pass
      - Acceptance criterion 3: documentation updated

  # Minimal task (only required fields)
  - id: 2
    title: Example task - add tests
    completed: false

  # Task with parallel grouping
  # Tasks in different groups can run in parallel
  - id: 3
    title: Implement backend API endpoint
    group: backend
    completed: false
    acceptance:
      - API endpoint responds with correct data
      - Error handling implemented
      - Tests cover happy path and error cases

  - id: 4
    title: Create frontend UI component
    group: frontend # Different group = can run in parallel with backend
    completed: false

# Common parallel groups:
# - backend: Backend/API tasks
# - frontend: UI/frontend tasks
# - database: Database schema/migration tasks
# - testing: Test implementation tasks
# - docs: Documentation tasks
# - infra: Infrastructure/deployment tasks
#
# Tasks in the same group run sequentially.
# Tasks in different groups can run in parallel (with --parallel flag).
#
# Usage:
#   ralph run --agent codex              # Sequential execution
#   ralph run --agent codex --parallel   # Parallel execution
#   ralph status                         # Show progress
#   ralph convert tasks.yaml PRD.md      # Convert to Markdown
