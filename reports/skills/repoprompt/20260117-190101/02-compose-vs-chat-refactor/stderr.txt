Should I use Compose or Chat mode for a large refactor?

# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

Objective: recommend whether Compose or Chat mode in Repo Prompt for a large refactor, aligned to your workflow.

Plan:
1) Confirm your workflow type and tooling (editor-first vs chat-first).
2) Match the mode to refactor needs (reasoning vs tight edit loop).
3) Provide a default recommendation plus alternatives.
4) Give a minimal context strategy and a quick smoke test.

Next step: confirm your primary workflow so I can lock the recommendation.

Recommendation (default): use Compose for a large refactor if you want deeper reasoning and a clean apply step. It’s best when you plan in a reasoning model, then apply multi-file changes via Apply/Pro Edit. Use Chat mode if you want a faster, tighter in-app loop with iterative diffs and less context export overhead.

Quick context strategy:
- Full: files you’ll change.
- Slices: large files where only a section is relevant.
- Codemaps: dependencies you need to reference but won’t edit.

Smoke test:
- Select 2–3 target files, build prompt, request a small change, and apply.

Binary question: Is your primary workflow chat-first (external model) rather than editor-first?
