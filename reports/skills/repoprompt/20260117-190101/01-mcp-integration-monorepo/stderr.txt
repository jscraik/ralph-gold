# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

# Repo Prompt Source Notes (Provided)

Use this as source material for summaries and explanations. Prefer concise paraphrase over long quotes. Avoid inventing pricing or feature availability; use what is here or ask.

## Overview

Repo Prompt helps build token-efficient, context-rich prompts so AI models understand code better. It targets the common problem of too little context (hallucinations) vs too much (token waste). Typical pain points:
- Manual copy/paste of files
- Blind agent discovery that burns tokens
- Paying per-token API costs for discovery

### Solution summary
1) Token-efficient context building
- Full content for active files
- Slices for targeted ranges
- Codemaps for signatures only

2) Use existing AI subscriptions via CLI providers
- Claude MAX / ChatGPT Plus or Pro / Google AI

**Preparing binary question about workflow**

I'm focusing on confirming workflow and constraints with a single yes/no question to guide next steps, then planning integration, setup, context handling, and validation accordingly.
codex
Using skill: repoprompt (you asked to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo).

Objective: integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo, choosing the right workflow and context strategy.

Plan:
1) Confirm workflow, repo shape, and constraints (editor-first vs chat-first, monorepo structure, token/cost/security).
2) Select the best integration path (MCP-backed editor vs Compose/Chat vs rp-cli) with a recommendation.
3) Provide a short setup checklist tailored to Claude Code + monorepo.
4) Define a context strategy (full vs slices vs codemaps; multi-root handling).
5) Run a smoke test checklist to validate the integration.

Next step: decide whether to run a brief requirements interview.

Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically? (yes/no)
