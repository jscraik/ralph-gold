Objective: Decide between Compose and Chat mode for a large refactor.

Plan:
1) Define what you need from the model (planning vs. code changes).
2) Map those needs to Compose vs. Chat capabilities.
3) Pick a default and a fallback mode.

Next step: Share whether you want help planning the refactor or executing edits first.

Recommendation: Use Compose for large refactors because it lets you curate file context and apply structured changes; switch to Chat for quick questions or when you need fast reasoning without heavy context.

Action: Do you want me to outline a Compose-first workflow for your refactor?
