**Advising on response format**

The user needs brief guidance on response format preferences and a mention of Codex UI. I'll confirm that the AGENTS format involves restating the question, planning, next steps, and ending with an action or binary question, then recommend keeping it simple and clear.

Objective: Decide between Compose and Chat mode for a large refactor.

Plan:
1) Define what you need from the model (planning vs. code changes).
2) Map those needs to Compose vs. Chat capabilities.
3) Pick a default and a fallback mode.

Next step: Share whether you want help planning the refactor or executing edits first.

Recommendation: Use Compose for large refactors because it lets you curate file context and apply structured changes; switch to Chat for quick questions or when you need fast reasoning without heavy context.

Action: Do you want me to outline a Compose-first workflow for your refactor?
