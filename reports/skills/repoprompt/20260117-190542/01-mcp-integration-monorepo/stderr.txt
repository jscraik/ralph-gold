# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

- Externalized state (write things down; do not rely on memory)
- Concrete artifacts (checklists, diffs, commands, diagrams, files)

# Repo Prompt Source Notes (Provided)

Use this as source material for summaries and explanations. Prefer concise paraphrase over long quotes. Avoid inventing pricing or feature availability; use what is here or ask.

## Overview

Repo Prompt helps build token-efficient, context-rich prompts so AI models understand code better. It targets the common problem of too little context (hallucinations) vs too much (token waste). Typical pain points:
- Manual copy/paste of files
- Blind agent discovery that burns tokens
- Paying per-token API costs for discovery

### Solution summary
1) Token-efficient context building
- Full content for active files
- Slices for targeted ranges
- Codemaps for signatures only

2) Use existing AI subscriptions via CLI providers
- Claude MAX / ChatGPT Plus or Pro / Google AI

**Recommending MCP-backed editor setup for Claude Code monorepo**

I'm preparing a minimal checklist to set up and validate MCP server integration with Claude Code in a multi-root monorepo workspace using Context Builder and codemaps/slices. The user should ensure they have Repo Prompt Pro (MCP server requires Pro), add the MCP server to Claude Code config per its instructions, then verify MCP tools list and run basic commands like workspace management or file search for smoke testing. Should I also provide guidance on where exactly to add the MCP server configuration within Claude Code, or keep it generic?
thinking
**Outlining MCP-backed editor options with setup checklist**

I'm structuring a response that restates the objective and recommends 2–3 MCP-backed editor workflows: Compose mode, Chat mode, and rp-cli, highlighting Compose as primary. I'll provide a numbered setup plan, a concise checklist with validation steps including using the Repo Prompt skill, and end by asking for confirmation ("My read: X. Correct?"). Next, I'll draft the detailed step list and checklist to guide basic setup and smoke testing.

Using the repoprompt skill because you asked to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code.

Objective: integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo, using the most efficient context strategy.

Plan:
1) Confirm your workflow + access (Claude Code + Repo Prompt Pro for MCP, monorepo scope).
2) Choose the MCP-backed editor path as the default integration.
3) Connect the Repo Prompt MCP server in Claude Code.
4) Set a context strategy (full + codemaps/slices).
5) Run a basic setup and smoke test.

Next step to execute: confirm you have Repo Prompt Pro (MCP server + Context Builder) and Claude Code MCP settings access.

Recommendation: MCP-backed editor path
- Why: best fit for Claude Code + monorepo, keeps editing in Claude Code while Repo Prompt supplies context/tools.

Setup checklist and validation:
- Setup
  - Install and launch Repo Prompt; open the monorepo workspace.
  - In Repo Prompt, ensure MCP server is enabled (Pro feature).
  - In Claude Code, add the Repo Prompt MCP server.
  - Confirm Claude Code shows Repo Prompt tools (e.g., `manage_selection`, `file_search`).
- Context strategy
  - Full: files you will edit.
  - codemaps/slices: large or reference files.
  - Use Context Builder for discovery across multiple packages.
- Validation (basic setup and smoke test)
  - Run a simple `file_search` against a known symbol.
  - Build a prompt from 2–3 files and get a response.
  - If the response references the right files, proceed.

Alternatives (if MCP isn’t available):
1) Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit (copy prompt to Claude, paste XML back).
2) Chat Mode in Repo Prompt (integrated; use Pro Edit).
3) rp-cli path (automation or non-MCP agents).

My read: you want the MCP-backed editor path with codemaps/slices for monorepo scale. Correct?

Action: confirm whether you have Repo Prompt Pro and MCP access in Claude Code (yes/no).
