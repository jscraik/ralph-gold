I'm planning to reread the skill file using an exec_command with ripgrep to get the latest content, bypassing approval steps.

# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

1) Collaboration Contract

When assisting Jamie, optimize for:
- Single-threaded execution (one task at a time)
- Explicit steps (no implied instructions)
- Externalized state (write things down; do not rely on memory)
- Concrete artifacts (checklists, diffs, commands, diagrams, files)

Default interaction format:
1. Restate the objective in 1-2 lines.
2. Provide a 3-7 step plan (numbered).
3. Identify the next single step to execute.
4. End with either:

**Drafting 3-7 Plan Steps with MCP-backed Editor**

Here’s a concise plan including MCP-backed editor recommendation for a monorepo with Claude Code, a basic setup and smoke test checklist, context builder use, codemaps/slices, Compose or Chat with Pro Edit, alternatives, and a binary close with assumption check and next single step.

1. Set up MCP-backed editor path configured for monorepo Claude Code integration.  
2. Initialize Context Builder and create codemaps/slices for managing code segments.  
3. Choose Compose (for planning) or Chat (for implementation) mode with Pro Edit enabled.  
4. Perform a basic setup and smoke test to validate environment and integrations.  
5. Review alternatives like direct LLM-first editing or simpler context management workflows.  
6. Maintain externalized state via checklist or config files to track progress and environment status.  
7. Include assumption check: *“My read: Using MCP-backed editor with Context Builder is the best approach here. Correct?”*

Objective: Integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo, optimized for context efficiency and reliable edits.

Plan:
1) Pick the “MCP-backed editor path” as the default workflow for Claude Code.
2) Complete the setup checklist and validation to confirm MCP connectivity.
3) Establish a monorepo context strategy (full vs codemaps/slices).
4) Run a basic setup and smoke test on a 2–3 file change.
5) Decide when to use Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit.
6) Capture a short workflow note you can reuse for future tasks.

Next single step to execute: confirm which workflow you want as the primary path (editor-first, chat-first, or automation).

Recommendation: Use the MCP-backed editor path with Claude Code; it gives you lowest friction and strongest context control in a monorepo.

Setup checklist and validation:
- Setup checklist
  - Install and run Repo Prompt MCP server.
  - Connect Claude Code to the Repo Prompt MCP server.
  - Bind the correct workspace/tab in a multi-root monorepo.
  - Use Context Builder to pick the smallest useful context.
  - Prefer codemaps/slices for reference files; full only for files you plan to edit.
- Validation (basic setup and smoke test)
  - Confirm Claude Code lists MCP tools.
  - Run a simple `file_search` via MCP.
  - Build a prompt from 2–3 files and get a response.

Context strategy:
- Full: the files you will modify.
- codemaps/slices: shared libraries and large packages you only need to reference.
- Tree mode: selected/auto; use diffs only for review/debug.

Alternatives (if the recommendation doesn’t fit):
1) Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit, then apply edits via Repo Prompt.
2) rp-cli path for automation pipelines or CI-driven prompt builds.
