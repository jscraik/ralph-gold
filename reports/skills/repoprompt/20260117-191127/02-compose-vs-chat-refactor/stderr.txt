Should I use Compose or Chat mode for a large refactor?

I'm retrieving SKILL.md to understand the skill details, then I'll restate the objective and plan a concise next-step approach.

# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

**Recommending refactor workflow**

Objective: Plan and implement a large refactor efficiently.  
Plan:  
1. Use Compose for detailed planning and breaking down tasks.  
2. Use Chat with Pro Edit for coding implementation.  
3. Leverage Context Builder to supply relevant context.  
4. Utilize codemaps and slices to navigate and manage code sections.  
5. Follow default interaction format for clarity.  
6. Regularly review progress and adjust plan as needed.  
7. Keep communication minimal and focused.

Next step: Create a high-level Compose outline for the refactor plan.

Should I start by drafting the Compose plan now? (yes/no)
codex
Objective: Decide whether to use Compose or Chat mode in Repo Prompt for a large refactor and pick a safe default.

Plan:
1) Choose the workflow goal (planning vs implementation) for the refactor.
2) Select the Repo Prompt path: Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit.
3) Set a context strategy: full files to edit + codemaps/slices for dependencies.
4) Run a basic setup and smoke test to validate context and tool access.

Next step to execute: Confirm whether you want to plan first or implement first.

Recommendation: Use Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit. For a large refactor, start in Compose with Context Builder and codemaps/slices, then switch to Chat for applying edits once the plan is locked.

Options:
- MCP-backed editor path (best if you want in-editor edits and strong context tools).
- Chat Mode in Repo Prompt (fastest for implementation with Pro Edit).
- rp-cli path (automation-heavy workflows).

Should I proceed with the recommendation to start in Compose for planning?
