**Planning skill file read**

I'm preparing to read the skill file using cat to gather necessary command details and confirm how to proceed with the integration plan; I'll end with a binary question about using the /interview-me flow.

# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

**Planning reads of user profile and override files**

I'll read /.codex/AGENTS.override.md and USER_PROFILE.md as instructed to ensure compliance and properly reference user profile guidance before proceeding.

1) Collaboration Contract

When assisting Jamie, optimize for:
- Single-threaded execution (one task at a time)
- Explicit steps (no implied instructions)
- Externalized state (write things down; do not rely on memory)
- Concrete artifacts (checklists, diffs, commands, diagrams, files)

Default interaction format:
1. Restate the objective in 1-2 lines.
2. Provide a 3-7 step plan (numbered).
3. Identify the next single step to execute.
4. End with either:

**Outlining minimal plan with info-gathering step**

The objective is to develop a repeatable editor workflow leveraging MCP-backed tools (like Claude Code if supported) for multi-root monorepos with context strategies (codemaps, slices). The plan includes validating environment capabilities, setting up RepoPrompt workspaces with multi-root support, designing context builders, and smoke testing edits. Next, I'll gather detailed info on the user's workflow, repo structure, model access, and constraints, then ask if I should use /interview-me for systematic exploration. Meanwhile, I provide a minimal recommended path and checklist covering MCP usage assumptions, context strategies, multi-root binding, and fallback to rp-cli.

**Providing structured plan with checklist and final binary question**

I'm preparing a concise response including a simple ASCII diagram illustrating the MCP-backed RepoPrompt workflow for Claude Code in a monorepo, emphasizing constraints like no secret requests and no unapproved dependency changes. The plan restates the objective with key steps, offers a minimal setup and smoke test checklist, and embeds an assumption statement for confirmation. The final line will ask only one clear binary question: whether to use /interview-me to explore this systematically.

Objective: Integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo, with a low-friction, reliable workflow and a clear validation path.

Plan:
1) Pick the best integration path for your workflow (MCP-backed editor path vs rp-cli path).
2) Define a monorepo context strategy (full files + codemaps/slices + multi-root binding).
3) Draft a setup checklist and validation gates.
4) Run a basic setup and smoke test to confirm tools and context flow.
5) Lock in the default workflow (Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit).
6) Document the working path as a short runbook.

Next single step: choose the integration path so I can tailor the checklist and smoke test.

**Recommended path (default)**  
MCP-backed editor path: use Repo Prompt as a context backend for Claude Code, then edit directly in Claude Code.

**Minimal setup checklist and validation (monorepo)**
1) Confirm Repo Prompt is installed and can open the monorepo workspace.
2) Connect the Repo Prompt MCP server inside Claude Code (if MCP is supported in your environment).
3) In Repo Prompt, bind to the correct workspace/tab (avoid multi-window drift).
4) Use Context Builder to discover targets; select full files for edits + codemaps/slices for dependencies.
5) Run a basic setup and smoke test: `file_search` on a known filename + build a prompt for 2–3 files.
6) If MCP isn’t available, switch to the rp-cli path for prompt building and manual apply.

**Context strategy (token-efficient defaults)**
- Full: files you will edit
- codemaps/slices: large or dependency files
- Avoid dumping the full repo unless a search fails
- For monorepos: treat each package as a root; slice within packages to keep context tight

**Alternatives (if MCP is not available or you prefer CLI)**
- rp-cli path: build prompt via CLI → paste into Claude Code → apply edits manually.
- Compose → External Chat: use Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit.

Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
