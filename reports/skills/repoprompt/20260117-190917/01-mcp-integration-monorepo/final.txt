Objective: Integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo, with a low-friction, reliable workflow and a clear validation path.

Plan:
1) Pick the best integration path for your workflow (MCP-backed editor path vs rp-cli path).
2) Define a monorepo context strategy (full files + codemaps/slices + multi-root binding).
3) Draft a setup checklist and validation gates.
4) Run a basic setup and smoke test to confirm tools and context flow.
5) Lock in the default workflow (Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit).
6) Document the working path as a short runbook.

Next single step: choose the integration path so I can tailor the checklist and smoke test.

**Recommended path (default)**  
MCP-backed editor path: use Repo Prompt as a context backend for Claude Code, then edit directly in Claude Code.

**Minimal setup checklist and validation (monorepo)**
1) Confirm Repo Prompt is installed and can open the monorepo workspace.
2) Connect the Repo Prompt MCP server inside Claude Code (if MCP is supported in your environment).
3) In Repo Prompt, bind to the correct workspace/tab (avoid multi-window drift).
4) Use Context Builder to discover targets; select full files for edits + codemaps/slices for dependencies.
5) Run a basic setup and smoke test: `file_search` on a known filename + build a prompt for 2–3 files.
6) If MCP isn’t available, switch to the rp-cli path for prompt building and manual apply.

**Context strategy (token-efficient defaults)**
- Full: files you will edit
- codemaps/slices: large or dependency files
- Avoid dumping the full repo unless a search fails
- For monorepos: treat each package as a root; slice within packages to keep context tight

**Alternatives (if MCP is not available or you prefer CLI)**
- rp-cli path: build prompt via CLI → paste into Claude Code → apply edits manually.
- Compose → External Chat: use Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit.

Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
