**Planning to read SKILL.md**

I'm preparing to read the SKILL.md file to gather details for the skill reprompt, choosing straightforward file reading since sandbox read-only access is available.

# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

**Preparing to clarify task approach**

Planning to restate the objective, outline a few clear steps, and then confirm the preferred workflow—either composition/planning or direct implementation with editing. I'll provide a minimal recommendation and ask a clarifying yes/no question to align next actions effectively.
codex
Objective: Decide whether to use Compose or Chat mode in Repo Prompt for a large refactor.

Plan:
1) Clarify your workflow (editor-first vs chat-first) and refactor scope.
2) Recommend a default path (Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit).
3) Specify a context strategy (codemaps/slices vs full files).
4) Provide a setup checklist and validation.
5) Confirm the next single action.

Next step to execute: Choose the default path based on your workflow preference.

Recommendation (default): Use Compose for planning or Chat for implementation with Pro Edit.  
- Compose excels at big-picture reasoning and structuring changes for large refactors.  
- Chat mode is best once the plan is set and you want to apply multi-file diffs.

Context strategy: Start with codemaps/slices, then promote to full only for files you’ll edit.

Setup checklist and validation:
- Bind to the right workspace/tab.
- Use Context Builder to map dependencies.
- Select target files; use codemaps/slices for large files.
- Run a smoke test: small prompt + confirm tool access.

Would you like me to recommend based on your workflow (editor-first vs chat-first)? (yes/no)
