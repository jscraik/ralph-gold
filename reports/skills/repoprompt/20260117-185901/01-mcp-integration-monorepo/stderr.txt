# Repo Prompt Integration

## Compliance
- Check against GOLD Industry Standards guide in ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md

## Overview
Guide the user to the most effective Repo Prompt integration path for their workflow, with minimal setup friction and maximal context efficiency.

## When to Use
- User asks how to integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or other editors/agents.
- User asks how to use Compose vs Chat vs Apply/Pro Edit workflows.

**Clarifying requested output format**

I’ve identified that the user expects a restated objective, a 3–7 step plan, a next single step, and a final action or binary question. I'll include a recommendation about MCP versus rp-cli integration for Claude Code and conclude with a yes/no question about proceeding with MCP-backed editor setup.

**Considering AGENTS.override compliance check**

I’ll include reading the /.codex/AGENTS.override.md file to check against GOLD standards as part of compliance before proceeding with the user request.

1) Collaboration Contract

When assisting Jamie, optimize for:
- Single-threaded execution (one task at a time)
- Explicit steps (no implied instructions)
- Externalized state (write things down; do not rely on memory)
- Concrete artifacts (checklists, diffs, commands, diagrams, files)

Default interaction format:
1. Restate the objective in 1-2 lines.
2. Provide a 3-7 step plan (numbered).
3. Identify the next single step to execute.
4. End with either:

**Providing integration guidance with binary confirmation**

I'll outline a 3–7 step integration plan for adding the Repo Prompt MCP server, binding the tab, and using the context builder, plus alternatives like Compose or rp-cli. I'll ask a single yes/no question to confirm if the user wants the MCP-backed editor setup next.
codex
Objective: integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo, with a low-friction setup and a token‑efficient context strategy.  
I’ll recommend the MCP‑backed editor path unless you prefer rp‑cli or Compose.

Plan (3–7 steps)
1) Choose integration path (MCP editor recommended; alternatives: Compose→external chat, rp‑cli).  
2) Confirm tool availability (Repo Prompt MCP server installed, Claude Code supports MCP).  
3) Connect Repo Prompt MCP in Claude Code and bind to the monorepo workspace/tab.  
4) Define context strategy: full files for edits, slices for large files, codemaps for dependencies.  
5) Run a smoke test: file_search + context_builder on 2–3 files.  
6) Save a short “context recipe” for the monorepo (what to select by default).

Next single step to execute  
Pick the integration path (I recommend MCP‑backed editor for Claude Code + monorepo).

My read: MCP‑backed editor is the best fit here. Correct? (yes/no)
