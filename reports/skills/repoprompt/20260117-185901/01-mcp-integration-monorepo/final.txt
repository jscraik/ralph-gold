Objective: integrate Repo Prompt with Claude Code for a monorepo, with a low-friction setup and a token‑efficient context strategy.  
I’ll recommend the MCP‑backed editor path unless you prefer rp‑cli or Compose.

Plan (3–7 steps)
1) Choose integration path (MCP editor recommended; alternatives: Compose→external chat, rp‑cli).  
2) Confirm tool availability (Repo Prompt MCP server installed, Claude Code supports MCP).  
3) Connect Repo Prompt MCP in Claude Code and bind to the monorepo workspace/tab.  
4) Define context strategy: full files for edits, slices for large files, codemaps for dependencies.  
5) Run a smoke test: file_search + context_builder on 2–3 files.  
6) Save a short “context recipe” for the monorepo (what to select by default).

Next single step to execute  
Pick the integration path (I recommend MCP‑backed editor for Claude Code + monorepo).

My read: MCP‑backed editor is the best fit here. Correct? (yes/no)
